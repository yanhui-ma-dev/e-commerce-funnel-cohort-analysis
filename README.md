## 📌 Project Overview

Digital businesses often struggle to connect user behaviour data with 
commercial outcomes such as revenue and conversion performance.

This project analyzes **1.6M+ user behaviour records** to build a scalable 
analytics workflow that transforms raw behavioural data into actionable 
commercial KPIs.

The analysis supports business teams in:

• Evaluating marketing channel performance  
• Identifying conversion bottlenecks in the customer funnel  
• Quantifying potential revenue opportunities  
• Enabling data-driven decision making

# 💰 Executive Impact Summary

Using session-level revenue aggregation:

- **Total Revenue:** $6,348,004.87  
- **Total Orders:** 155,617  
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $40.79  

### Estimated Revenue Opportunities

- **+5 percentage-point lift in Cart → Purchase conversion**  
  → **+$812K incremental revenue**

- **Optimizing checkout friction for high-engagement brand "runail"**  
  → **~$85K potential uplift**

- **Reducing extreme cart abandonment for "kapous"**  
  → **$30–50K revenue opportunity**

All projections are based on session-level AOV to reflect true order economics.

# 📊 Key Analysis & Insights

## 1️⃣ Overall Funnel Conversion (Macro View)

Tracked **1,639,358 unique visitors** across a four-stage funnel:

| Stage | Users |
|-------|--------|
| Total Visitors | 1,639,358 |
| Product Viewers | 1,597,754 |
| Cart Adders | 398,308 |
| Final Buyers | 110,518 |

![Overall Funnel Chart](images/funnel_conversion_chart.png)

### Core Bottlenecks

- **View → Cart:** 75.1% drop-off  
  → Indicates potential pricing, positioning, or product page friction  

- **Cart → Purchase:** 72.3% drop-off  
  → Suggests checkout friction, payment barriers, or shipping cost sensitivity

## 2️⃣ Category & Brand-Level Breakdown

Conversion performance varies significantly by product category and brand.

| category_id | brand | viewers | cart_adders | buyers | add_to_cart_rate | purchase_rate |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1602943681873052386 | grattol | 83,670 | 36,398 | 12,594 | 43.5% | 34.6% |
| 1487580013950664926 | None | 69,436 | 11,283 | 2,953 | 16.2% | 26.2% |
| 1487580013841613016 | kapous | 61,251 | 7,463 | 2,431 | 12.2% | 32.6% |
| 1487580005092295511 | None | 52,449 | 31,086 | 11,020 | 59.3% | 35.5% |
| 1487580005134238553 | runail | 27,225 | 20,807 | 6,465 | 76.4% | 31.1% |

#### **Drop-off Heatmap Insights**
| Add-to-Cart Drop-off | Purchase Drop-off |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Add-to-Cart Heatmap](images/Add_to_Cart_Drop_off_Rate_Heatmap.png) | ![Purchase Heatmap](images/purchase_drop_off_rate_heatmap.png) |

### Brand-Level Insights

- **Friction Identification:**  
  Brand *kapous* exhibits extreme cart abandonment (~88%), indicating major conversion barriers.

- **High-Potential Segment:**  
  *runail* demonstrates strong engagement (76.4% add-to-cart rate) but suffers from 69% payment drop-off — making it a prime candidate for checkout optimization.

---

## 3️⃣ Cohort Retention Analysis

Users were segmented by first purchase month and tracked over a 5-month horizon.

![Cohort Retention Rate Heatmap](images/cohort_retention_rate_heatmap.png)

### Retention Decay Insight

- October 2019 cohort: **18.5% Month-1 retention**
- December 2019 cohort: **8.5% Month-1 retention**

This represents a **54.1% decline**, suggesting holiday-driven acquisition generates lower long-term loyalty compared to standard-period customers.

---

# 📐 Key Metrics Definition

To ensure analytical rigor, the following core metrics were defined:

### Conversion Rate

Conversion Rate = Conversions ÷ Users at Previous Funnel Stage  

Examples:
- View → Cart = Cart Adders ÷ Product Viewers  
- Cart → Purchase = Buyers ÷ Cart Adders  

---

### Drop-off Rate

Drop-off Rate = 1 − Conversion Rate  

Or equivalently:

Drop-off Rate = (Users at Previous Stage − Users at Next Stage) ÷ Users at Previous Stage  

Example:
Cart Drop-off = (Cart Adders − Buyers) ÷ Cart Adders  

---

### Average Order Value (AOV)

Because a session may contain multiple purchase events (multiple items per order), revenue was aggregated at the **session level**.

AOV = Total Revenue ÷ Total Orders  

Where:
- Total Revenue = SUM(price) for purchase events  
- Total Orders = COUNT(DISTINCT user_session)  

In this dataset:
- Total Revenue = $6,348,004.87  
- Total Orders = 155,617  
- AOV = $40.79  

All revenue projections in this project are based on session-level AOV.

# 🚀 Strategic Recommendations

Based on data-driven findings:

### 🎯 Targeted Retargeting
Deploy abandoned cart email / paid remarketing for high-engagement brands (e.g., runail, grattol).

### 💳 Checkout Optimization
Reduce payment friction by:
- Guest checkout options  
- One-click payment  
- Transparent shipping costs  
- Streamlined mobile checkout  

### 📧 Lifecycle Management
Implement automated post-purchase onboarding and retention campaigns, especially for Q4-acquired cohorts.

## 📈 Business Value

This project demonstrates how behavioral event data can be transformed into:

- Funnel diagnostics  
- Revenue impact modeling  
- Segment-level performance optimization  
- Cohort-based retention strategy
- BI dashboard development for ongoing performance monitoring

Bridging **Raw behavioral data → Performance insights → Capital allocation decisions**

Enabling data-informed growth strategy rather than isolated reporting.
